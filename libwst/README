Overview
~~~~~~~~

This library implements an interface to represent Microsoft Windows system
calls and their arguments. A system call is represented through a Syscall
object, and the arguments are SyscallArg objects. The library also offers the
ability to serialise and deserialise a Syscall object, and its arguments, to
(and from) a XML or BINARY stream.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The library currently supports only Microsoft Windows XP system calls.
